## Maze marker 
Hi, This code is a maze maker code that creates a number output which then could be input into the code found in the conversion file
You would input 
<seed>  the seed value for the random number generator
<N>     number of rows in the grid N > 0
<M>     number of cols in the grid M > 0
<fname> file name for the output

An example would be ./test 0 10 10 example.txt

You would run the code with g++ -std=c++11 -Wall main.cpp maze.cpp -o test
This code was part of a homework assignment for the Data Structures and Abstractions available at my school
